/*
 * This source only exists because some very special programs think that
 * it is a very special idea to access /dev/dsp by the means of stdio, so
 * we need to fake FILE* access for artsdsp as well.
 *
 * To do so, it relies on glibc internals, so that it will probably not work
 * on other systems - but then again, it might not be necessary on other
 * systems, when fopen properly calls open, it might as well work unchanged.
